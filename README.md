Reading and Writing to InfluxDB from various systems

To collect data from a Raspberry Pi we can install the python collector.py script and run it as a service. To do this, 
download and run the install_pi_collector.sh file using the following commands:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dowoco/InfluxDB/master/install_pi_collector.sh
bash ./install_pi_collector.sh
